# scrambler

A simple Clojure(script) app built with Duct, Reagent and cljs-ajax.

## Developing

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Then load the development environment.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to prep and initiate the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:duct.server.http.jetty/starting-server {:port 3000}
:initiated
```

The app should be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Things to try in the app

...so you can see error messages in action:

 - Leave one of the input boxes empty before click `Check`

 - Use a long string (> 40 characters)

 - Have an invalid character in one of the strings

 - Shutdown server but still use the app in browser

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server. Changes to CSS or ClojureScript
files will be hot-loaded into the browser.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

If you want to access a ClojureScript REPL, make sure that the site is loaded
in a browser and run:

```clojure
dev=> (cljs-repl)
Waiting for browser connection... Connected.
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
nil
cljs.user=>
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```
